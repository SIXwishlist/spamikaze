2004-05-08   Hans Spaans  <army@humbolt>

	* spamikaze/scripts/postfix.pl: Added Spamikaze.pm support
	Added Postgresql support
	Clean the code somewhat
	Temp-file are now being used while doing the generation

2004-05-05   Hans Spaans  <army@humbolt>

	* TODO: Updated.

2004-05-01   Hans Spaans  <army@humbolt>

	* TODO: Added two items need for the next release

2004-04-27   Hans Spaans  <army@humbolt>

	* TODO:
	Removed a wishlist item because it is in Spamikaze.pm and the rest of the
	scripts will get it because they need Spamikaze.pm ;-)

	* spamikaze/scripts/Spamikaze.pm, spamikaze/scripts/named.pl:
	- Added GetDBType() to Spamikaze.pm
	- named.pl is now working with Spamikaze.pm
	- named.pl doesn't call rndc anymore!!!
	- named.pl and Spamikaze.pm have been processed by perltidy -t
	- Fixed sql-calls with old parameter $ticks
	- Removed all legacy variables to config.pl

	* spamikaze/scripts/passivetrap.pl, spamikaze/spamikaze-pg.sql, spamikaze/spamikaze-sf.sql:
	The new database layout wasn't applied to all files and because we try to
	get everything working in cvs we needed to change somethings.

	So please read the changes or things WILL stop working. Sorry for this.

	* doc/example-config:
	Added config-items for named.pl. The idea is to do BIND first and if we
	need to support more nameserver we make a seperate configfile for this.

	* spamikaze/scripts/named2.pl:
	Named2.pl has been removed because it was merged into 1.2 of named.pl.

	* spamikaze/scripts/named.pl:
	Named2.pl has been merged into named.pl. If you have problemen, please
	check out an older version from cvs.

2004-04-26   Hans Spaans  <army@humbolt>

	* spamikaze/scripts/Spamikaze.pm:
	- Spamikaze.pm is now able to get its config by ini-file. Please see example-config.
	- Spamikaze.pm default ignore 127/8 addresses
	- Spamikaze.pm can ignore BOGON IP-addresses using Net::DNS
	- Spamikaze.pm can ignore RFC1918 IP-addresses if you don't want to use
	  the BOGON way of checking.

	* doc/example-config:
	Added an example for the spamikaze config in ~/.spamikaze/config and/or
	/etc/spamikaze/config.

	* spamikaze/scripts/passivetrap.pl:
	- Passivetrap is now capable to find Spamikaze.pm again;
	- The function mxbackup has been moved to Spamikaze::MXBackup;
	- Passivetrap now stops subscribing 127.0.0.1 as spammer.

	* spamikaze/scripts/Spamikaze.pm:
	- Spamikaze.pm now has MXBackup to check if it is MX of our own.
	- Added a 1 to be on the safeside.

	* spamikaze/spamikaze-pg.sql:
	The database-layout for pgsql is now compliant with mysql.

2004-04-25  Hans Wolters  <h-wolters@humbolt>

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/TODO-database: 		Database reorganisation
			$Id: ChangeLog,v 1.2 2004/05/15 02:46:31 cor Exp $


	In order to facilitate more flexible blocklisting, expiry, removal and
	whitelisting policies, a database redesign is necessary.  Before we can
	come up with such a new design, however, we should think about exactly
	what we want to store in the database.

	If you have ideas for other things that need to be stored, please email
	spamikaze@nl.linux.org or commit your idea to the list below.

	Data to store:
	- IP address of spam sending host
	- time each spam arrived
	- time of each IP address removal
	- number of spams received from each IP address
	- number of spams received from each IP address since last removal
	- time the IP address will automatically expire from the database,
	  calculated by the listing&expiry policy at the time the spam is
	  received
	- first characters of the subject of the spam (small enough to avoid
	  most unique tokens, 30 chars?)
	- email addresses to whitelist
	- number of IP addresses listed, per /24 (updated at listing and
	  unlisting time, used for easy block escalation)
	- same for /16 and /8 blocks, but for statistics only
	- the country each IP address is in, for statistics
	- the host name (from reverse DNS) for each IP address, for statistics
	  and per-domain queries


	The design of the database tables should be done once we have the
	requirements, or maybe earlier if the new design is flexible enough ;)

	        ) TYPE=MyISAM;

	and another field in the spammers table:

	ALTER TABLE spammers ADD c_id SMALLINT NOT NULL;

	It will store the countries from where the spammers will
	are spamming. This alteration and the one for the fqdn will
	be used to setup an admin/abuse interface in the future.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/expire.pl:

	Ok, this is a new expire that will use different options and will look
	for hostnames, etc....

	What do you need for it to work:

	A new table fqdn:

	CREATE TABLE `fqdn` (
	  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
	    `hostname` varchar(200) NOT NULL default '',
	      PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),
	        UNIQUE KEY `idx_hostname` (`hostname`(40))
	        ) TYPE=MyISAM;

	An altered spammers table:

	ALTER TABLE spammers ADD fqdn_id INT NOT NULL;

	What will expire.pl do:

	It will look for hostnames and ranges that will not be
	expired. Empty hostnames (blackholes) will not be expired
	anyhow. Currently I have a working setup that will start
	the expire at 7 days and look for a new variable ($extratime)
	for the additional expire time for attempt 2 and higher.

	Beware of using this since you need to fill the fqdn table
	first. Some altered scripts for this will follow.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/postfix.pl, /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/sendmail.pl:

	postfix: deleted the ticks line, the new expire.pl will be used to
	         expire.

	sendmail: made the connection use the Spamikaze.pm

	New var name for ranges that will not be expired.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/config.pl, /home/CVS/spamikaze/expire.pl:
	ok gang,

	This is an example of how the expire could be. I dropped them in the
	main dir and will remove them once I had comments.

	The idea.

	In the config.pl we have a @DONTEXPIRE. This will enable us
	to make sure certain ranges will not expire.

	The expire.pl should be run seperate (doesn't expire yet) and
	will expire ipnr's that are not listed in @DONTEXPIRE and are:

	* listed once in the db and are older then time() - $ticks.
	* expire ipnumbers listed <= $maxspamsperip and ore older then time()
	  and $ticks.

	Calculation for the ipnumbers with more then one spam:
	$bonustime = $spamtime + ($ticks * $total);
	If this is <= time() they can expire.

	The $maxspamperip will enable some of us to run a real dangerous list :-)

	The idea would be to run this expire instead of having sendmail.pl
	and named.pl looking at the the expiretime. They could just select
	everything that's not 0/FALSE (visible field).

	Any comments are welcome.

	Hans

	p.s. $_ will not list ipnr's starting with 0, we need some more bugfixing.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/INSTALL:
	Altered the install a little.

	needs to be done in the documentation.

	logical but I wonder if it's not default in perl.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/config/config.pl:
	Added @BLACKLISTDOMAINS and @BLACKLISTRANGES. No matter what kind of expire
	we will use, this can be handy. Code for the expire will follow.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/named.pl:
	Named.pl now works with Postgresql. The code is quite a mess, but maybe
	we can merge code with MySQL.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/config/config.pl:
	Fixed a typo because the selection for a dbserver has changed.

	Passivetrap.pl is now capable of working with both MySQL as Postgresql.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/config/config.pl: Added variables for:
	- type of dbserver;
	- the host the database is running on;
	- the port of the dbserver.
	The last two are currently only used for Postgresql dbservers.

	Updated the todolist with things we needed to do before the next release.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/passivetrap.pl:
	Here are some backports from my pgsql-tree:
	- passivetrap.pl now uses strict;
	- fixed variables in main because of the introduction of strict;
	- changed a shift to be consistent in the way we handle parameters.

	K, this should fix the security problem Hans Spaans mentioned. It's the old
	situation. The patch from John does check for empty lines correctly but it
	disables people to import spam using mbox? format. We should take a closer
	look to this.

2003-07-20  h-wolters  <h-wolters@cleopatra>

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/passivetrap.pl:

	K guys, with a little help from Niwo this file could be the template for

	the logo in it (the small one).

	Once I have the time to work on the site again I will help improve it. This
	far it runs on most browsers ok but we need to validate that before going live.

	Rik, I don't like to distribute the layout for Spamikaze, can we use the blanks for that?

	Regards,

	Hans
