	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/TODO-database: 		Database reorganisation
			$Id: ChangeLog,v 1.1 2004/03/20 19:46:11 riel Exp $


	In order to facilitate more flexible blocklisting, expiry, removal and
	whitelisting policies, a database redesign is necessary.  Before we can
	come up with such a new design, however, we should think about exactly
	what we want to store in the database.

	If you have ideas for other things that need to be stored, please email
	spamikaze@nl.linux.org or commit your idea to the list below.

	Data to store:
	- IP address of spam sending host
	- time each spam arrived
	- time of each IP address removal
	- number of spams received from each IP address
	- number of spams received from each IP address since last removal
	- time the IP address will automatically expire from the database,
	  calculated by the listing&expiry policy at the time the spam is
	  received
	- first characters of the subject of the spam (small enough to avoid
	  most unique tokens, 30 chars?)
	- email addresses to whitelist
	- number of IP addresses listed, per /24 (updated at listing and
	  unlisting time, used for easy block escalation)
	- same for /16 and /8 blocks, but for statistics only
	- the country each IP address is in, for statistics
	- the host name (from reverse DNS) for each IP address, for statistics
	  and per-domain queries


	The design of the database tables should be done once we have the
	requirements, or maybe earlier if the new design is flexible enough ;)

	        ) TYPE=MyISAM;

	and another field in the spammers table:

	ALTER TABLE spammers ADD c_id SMALLINT NOT NULL;

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/expire.pl:

	Ok, this is a new expire that will use different options and will look
	for hostnames, etc....

	What do you need for it to work:

	A new table fqdn:

	CREATE TABLE `fqdn` (
	  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
	    `hostname` varchar(200) NOT NULL default '',
	      PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),
	        UNIQUE KEY `idx_hostname` (`hostname`(40))
	        ) TYPE=MyISAM;

	An altered spammers table:

	ALTER TABLE spammers ADD fqdn_id INT NOT NULL;

	What will expire.pl do:

	It will look for hostnames and ranges that will not be
	expired. Empty hostnames (blackholes) will not be expired
	anyhow. Currently I have a working setup that will start
	the expire at 7 days and look for a new variable ($extratime)
	for the additional expire time for attempt 2 and higher.

	Beware of using this since you need to fill the fqdn table
	first. Some altered scripts for this will follow.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/postfix.pl, /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/sendmail.pl:

	postfix: deleted the ticks line, the new expire.pl will be used to

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/config.pl, /home/CVS/spamikaze/expire.pl:
	ok gang,

	This is an example of how the expire could be. I dropped them in the
	main dir and will remove them once I had comments.

	The idea.

	In the config.pl we have a @DONTEXPIRE. This will enable us
	to make sure certain ranges will not expire.

	The expire.pl should be run seperate (doesn't expire yet) and
	will expire ipnr's that are not listed in @DONTEXPIRE and are:

	* listed once in the db and are older then time() - $ticks.
	* expire ipnumbers listed <= $maxspamsperip and ore older then time()
	  and $ticks.

	Calculation for the ipnumbers with more then one spam:
	$bonustime = $spamtime + ($ticks * $total);
	If this is <= time() they can expire.

	The $maxspamperip will enable some of us to run a real dangerous list :-)

	The idea would be to run this expire instead of having sendmail.pl
	and named.pl looking at the the expiretime. They could just select
	everything that's not 0/FALSE (visible field).

	Any comments are welcome.

	Hans

	p.s. $_ will not list ipnr's starting with 0, we need some more bugfixing.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/INSTALL:
	Altered the install a little.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/html/template.html:
	K guys, with a little help from Niwo this file could be the template for
	the site. It holds some extra links to non-excisting images but just parse
	the logo in it (the small one).

	Once I have the time to work on the site again I will help improve it. This
	far it runs on most browsers ok but we need to validate that before going live.

	Rik, I don't like to distribute the layout for Spamikaze, can we use the blanks for that?

	Regards,

	Hans
