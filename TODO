	TODO items for spamikaze


Before next release:
  * ???

For later versions:
  * IPv6 support
  * more scalable table layout for MySQL, similar to PostgreSQL 3 tables
  * integrate query statistics
  * sharing IP addresses with multiple spamikaze lists
  * (maybe) automatic escalation to netblocks if a lot of spam
    is received from netblocks

Wishlist:
* Templating for the webinterface
