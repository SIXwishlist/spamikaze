	TODO items for spamikaze


Before next release:
  * integrate the postgres code by devdas
  * add similar mysql code modularisation
  * integrate query statistics

For later versions:
  * Add evidence table
  * the perl scripts in cgi-bin should be able to do the same as there 
    php ones.
  * sharing IP addresses with multiple spamikaze lists
  * recognise mailing list and mailer daemon messages, do not
    lists hosts sending those
  * (maybe) automatic escalation to netblocks if a lot of spam
    is received from netblocks
  * teach named.pl to use nsupdate so nameservers can resync
    using IXFR instead of AXFR
	* getcountries.pl
	* statscountry.pl
	* stop using system()

Wishlist:
* Templating for the webinterface
