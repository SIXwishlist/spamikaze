	TODO items for spamikaze


Before next release:
  * basic documentation and postgres documentation.
  * test the current cvs tree on different machines.
  * add expire.pl to the tree if we all agree and alter 
    sendmail.pl and named.pl to only select on visible is true/1.
  * Fix the $_, this doesn't handle 0.x.x.x ipnumbers.

For later versions:
  * spamikaze website
  * the perl scripts in cgi-bin should be able to do the same as there 
    php ones.
  * sharing IP addresses with multiple spamikaze lists
  * recognise mailing list and mailer daemon messages, do not
    lists hosts sending those
  * (maybe) automatic escalation to netblocks if a lot of spam
    is received from netblocks
  * teach named.pl to use nsupdate so nameservers can resync
    using IXFR instead of AXFR
	* getcountries.pl
	* statscountry.pl
	* stop using system()
  * ...

Wishlist:
  * configuration in an ini-file in /etc/spamikaze/ or in ~/.spamikaze/
