<h1>Download Spamikaze</h1>

<h2>Spamikaze 0.1</h2>

This is the first alpha release of Spamikaze. The software works and
is in production on our own systems, but there are some rough edges
left, as well as many TODO items.

<p>Get it via
<!-- <a href="/pub/spamikaze-0.1.tar.gz">http</a> or -->
<a href="ftp://ftp.nl.linux.org/pub/spamikaze/spamikaze-0.1.tar.gz">ftp</a>.

<h2>Anonymous CVS</h2>

Spamikaze development can be followed up to the minute via anonymous
CVS. Note that there could be experimental things in CVS, though, so
only use a version from CVS if you know what you're doing.
