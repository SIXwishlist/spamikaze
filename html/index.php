<p>Spamikaze is an automated spam blocklist system, designed to:
<ul>
<li>block spam at the SMTP level
<li>reduce false positives
<li>work with existing mail servers
<li>make sending spam as annoying as receiving spam
</ul>

<p>Unlike some other spam blocking systems, Spamikaze does no tests for
open relay or open proxy vulnerabilities at all.  Instead, Spamikaze simply
lists the IP addresses that have sent spam and allows anybody to remove
IP addresses from the list.
